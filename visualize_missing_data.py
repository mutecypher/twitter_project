# Create a DataFrame with missing time series data
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, None, None, 5], 'B': [3, None, None, 6, 7]},
                  index=pd.date_range(start='2022-01-01', periods=5))

# Visualize the missing time series data
msno.matrix(df)


# This code creates a DataFrame with missing
# time series data, and then uses the msno.matrix()
# function to visualize the missing data.
# The resulting visualization shows the missing
# values as white blocks in the matrix, and
# the non-missing values as colored blocks.
# You can also use other visualization functions
# provided by missingno, such as msno.bar()
# and msno.heatmap(), to gain different insights
# into the missing data. For example, msno.bar()
# creates a bar chart that shows the proportion
# of missing values for each variable, and
# msno.heatmap() creates a heatmap that shows
# the correlation between missing values in different variables.
